# newchat-aws

first we created an instance in AWS with the basic setups - used ubuntu , used t2.micro instance type and created a key pair and configured the instance - and then launched it,
Then I got into the terminal to connect to the instance and then pefformed all the commands to set the dependancies,
Installed nginx node and pm2 for a basic production.
Set my project's frontend to run with the backend with the build file ,
cloned the git repo made directory in the instance then installed all the dependancies required to run it , then started the pm2 , when successfully got connected , I configued my nginx to run the program in 5000 port (server) ,  then again ran it , and my project was deployed to the public ip with the help of nginx server.

Happy coding!
